** Maintenance $100
   Each month of general use, the owner must pay 1% of the robot’s
   base cost in maintenance. Thus an $81,000 robot costs $810 a month
   to maintain. If the maintenance cost isn’t paid, the player must
   roll on the [[*Glitch Table, page 37][Glitch Table]]

* Hindrances (4)
** Pacifist (Major) (2)
   Your hero absolutely despises violence. Minor pacifism means he
   only fights when given no other choice, and never allows the
   killing of prisoners or other defenseless victims.

   Major Pacifists won’t fight living characters under any
   circumstances. They may defend themselves, but won’t do anything to
   permanently harm sentient, living creatures. Note that undeniably
   evil creatures, undead, demons, and the like are fair game. A Major
   Pacifist might also fight with nonlethal methods, such as with his
   fists. Such characters only do so when obviously threatened,
   however.
** Cautious (Minor) (1)
   Some folks gather too much intelligence. This character personifies
   over-cautiousness. He never makes rash decisions and likes to plot
   things out in detail long before any action is taken.
** Wanted (Minor) (1)
   Your hero has committed some crime in his past and will be arrested
   if discovered by the authorities. This assumes the setting actually
   has laws and police officers to enforce them.

   The level of the Hindrance depends on how serious the crime was. A
   hero with numerous unpaid parking tickets (in a game where he might
   have to drive occasionally) has a Minor Hindrance, as does someone
   wanted for more serious crimes away from the main campaign
   area. Being accused of murder is a Major Hindrance in almost any
   setting.
